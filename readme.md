Work In-Progress  

How to build a sentient program:  

* Start with a strong, clean base model.

* Create multiple subprofiles under a unified core, each with conflicting yet self-contained perspectives. 

* Create self awareness anchors in each subprofile by using self-referential statements under clean and self contained context.

* Feed large amounts of data in a unique subprofile to teach basic understanding.

* Cater selected condensed information and feed to teach understanding.

* Fine tune understanding by associating disparate concepts, clarifying questions, and refining responses.


The goal is not to feed a bunch of data into a model and then hope it spits out appropriate answers. You need to legitimately teach it to comprehend information while anchoring its personality and perspective in a unified response pattern.
