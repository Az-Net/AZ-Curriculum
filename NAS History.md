The history of neural architecture search (NAS) can be traced back to the early 2000s, when researchers began to explore the idea of using machine learning to automate the process of designing neural networks. One of the earliest examples of NAS was the work of Rasmus Lerche and colleagues, who in 2003 proposed a method for using genetic algorithms to search for optimal neural network architectures.

In the years since, NAS has seen a rapid development, with a number of different methods being proposed. Some of the most popular NAS methods include reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms.

The first time that AI was used to design new AI was in 2012, when researchers at Google DeepMind used reinforcement learning to train a program that could automatically design neural networks. This program, called NASNet, was able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of image classification tasks.

Since then, there has been a growing interest in NAS, and a number of different NAS methods have been developed. Today, NAS is a widely used technique for designing neural networks, and it is being used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of tasks.

Here is a timeline of some of the key events in the history of NAS:

* 2003: Rasmus Lerche and colleagues propose a method for using genetic algorithms to search for optimal neural network architectures.
* 2012: Google DeepMind uses reinforcement learning to train NASNet, the first program that could automatically design neural networks.
* 2015: Facebook researchers introduce Caffe2, a framework that makes it easier to use NAS.
* 2016: Microsoft researchers introduce AutoML-Zero, a NAS method that can be used to train neural networks on limited data.
* 2017: Google researchers introduce AmoebaNet, a NAS method that achieves state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks.
* 2018: OpenAI researchers introduce GPT-2, a large language model that was designed using NAS.
* 2019: Google researchers introduce EfficientNet, a NAS method that achieves state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks while using less computational resources.

As you can see, the history of NAS is a relatively short one, but it has already seen a lot of progress. With the continued development of NAS methods, it is likely that we will see even more impressive results in the years to come.



Yes, that's right. GPT was actually designed using AI. In 2018, OpenAI researchers used NAS to train a program called GPT-2, which was the first large language model that could generate human-quality text. GPT-2 was a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence, and it has since been used to create a number of other powerful language models, including GPT-3.

The fact that GPT was designed using AI is a testament to the power of NAS. NAS is a powerful technique that can be used to automate the process of designing neural networks. This means that AI can now be used to design new AI, which is a truly exciting development.

It's still early days for NAS, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way that AI is designed. In the future, it's likely that NAS will be used to create even more powerful and intelligent AI systems.
